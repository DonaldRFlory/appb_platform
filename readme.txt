Here are some notes on motors and other ping-pong-ball mechanism issues:


QCAD files are stored in:

Found that BE1104 motors (smaller in diameter than RS1306) go faster
and produce better air-flow than RS1306. Have settled on using BE1104
with BL-Heli ESC's and a four blade propellor.

BL-Heli ESC's may be programmed to work in reversable mode so that at middle
of servo range (1500 microsecond pulse) they are off and go backward at lower
setting and forward at higher settings.
